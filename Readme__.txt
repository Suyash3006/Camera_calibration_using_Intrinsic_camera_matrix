// this is readme file to see the code output of the uploaded python notebook.
we have uploaded the python Jupyter notebook which we have already ran it 
// so the outputs are visible behind the code cell 
  --- in case you want to run and test the code than set the path of the images accordingly and also intrinsic matrix .

// then only it will be able to run. 
 --- now just open the jupyter notebook using the colab in google drive or using the jupyter notebook on the localhost 
 //  there is also the .py file attached for the reference.
// you also need to install opencv , numpy and matplotlib libraries in order to run the code successfully 
// to install the libraries you need to  run the following command 
	pip install numpy
	pip install opencv-python 
	pip install matplotlib 
// There is no need of running the code as such as all the code runned and output are preserved in the output python 
jupyter notebook.
